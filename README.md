## cmake-clang-tools

[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#introduction) and broader
ecosystem comes with various useful tools for formatting, linting, and
instrumenting C and C++ code. These are example CMake modules for using
`clang-format`, `clang-tidy`, and various Clang runtime
instrumentation/sanitizers (ASan, MSan, etc.) that may be useful for doing C and
C++ development. See also:

- Clang's [documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html)
